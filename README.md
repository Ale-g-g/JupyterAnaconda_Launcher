# JupyterAnaconda_Launcher
.bat file that opens Jupyter Notebook without having to open Anaconda Navigator.
It can be used to automate other Anaconda add-ins as well!

It selects an existing environment of your choice, and opens Jupyter Notebook. More info inside the code

**Note*: I was tired of having to open Anaconda (painfully slow), select the environment, and then open Jupyter Notebook. With this file you are done in just one click ;)

## Instructions:
- Find your system Anaconda folder, and find activate.bat
  - <anaconda_dir>/Scripts/activate.bat <anaconda_dir>
- Edit the bat file and change [UserName] so the .activate.bat path is correct.
